----------
Problem 2
----------

To compile and run the code for Cell and CellTest:

1. Compile:
   javac Point.java Shape.java Circle.java Square.java TotalAreaCalculator.java Main.java

2. Execute:
   java Main.java S input.txt

Expected Output:
The output should display calculated areas for shapes such as circles and squares, as defined in the Main program.
This may include printing each shape's area as calculated by TotalAreaCalculator and any details as defined in Main.

Example output:
Circle[position=(16.5, 10.5), radius=52.0, area=8494.8665353068]
Square[position=(73.5, 35.0), side=100.0, area=10000.0]
Total Area of all shapes: 24620.953051077784


----------
Problem 3
----------

To compile and run the code for Cell and CellTest:

1. Compile:
   javac Cell.java CellTest.java

2. Execute:
   java CellTest

Expected Output:
The output should display the results of operations performed on Cell objects as defined in CellTest.
Example output could include creating Cell instances, manipulating them, and displaying them in the specified format.
Adjust the exact expectations based on the methods tested in CellTest.

Expected Output:
1 22 21 12 24 17
sum of intlist is 97
sum of null list is 0

1.0 16.0 13.72 5.0 22.0 7.1
sum ints = 97.0
sum doubles = 64.82
----------
Problem 4
----------

To compile and run the code for CellList and CellListTest:

1. Compile:
   javac Cell.java CellList.java CellListTest.java

2. Execute:
   java CellListTest

Expected Output:
The output should display operations performed on the CellList data structure, including `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and
displaying the contents of the list in the specified format. It should reflect linked list manipulations like adding
elements to the head, removing elements from the head, and showing the current list structure.

Example output:
[(head: 1) -> (2) -> (3)]
Popped: 1
[(head: 2) -> (3)]

This output will reflect the results of list operations as defined in CellListTest.
